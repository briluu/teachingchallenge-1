# teachingchallenge
A repository for the INFO 343 teaching challenge assignment.

This repository includes starter and completed demonstration files to teach a learner
how to use the Google JavaScript API Library to access the Google APIs. In the demo a simple
website is created using AngularJS and the Google Drive API to display 10 files from an authenticated user's 
Google Drive. The accompanying demonstration video walks the learner through the required steps to complete the 
project.
